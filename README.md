# Data Visualisation: Property Investment in London
Exploratory data analysis for property investment in London.  
[Report](https://github.com/SoumyaO/data-viz-property-london/blob/main/Report.pdf)

## Overview
This project aims to identify profitable boroughs in London to buy properties in and rent them out on Airbnb. Three sources of information were collated; Airbnb listings from Sept 2021-22, average historical housing prices in London (1996-2022) and annual council tax data by borough.

### Visualisation Design
Five different visualisations were generated in Tableau and a dashboard was created. Several kinds of visualisations were chosen, based on what best answers the questions at hand. The different visualisations were
1. Bar chart showing average Airbnb prices per night for each borough, with the length representing the price and the thickness representing the number of listings. A geo-heatmap was overlayed to highlight the differences between central London and the outer boroughs.  
2. Heatmaps showing the popularity of each room type by occupancy and by the number of reviews for each borough.  
3. Time series plots showing the trends of average house prices over time for each borough.  
4. A bar chart with annual income and expenses for each borough, overlayed on top of each other along with a radial chart indicating the return on investment.
5. A lollipop chart showing the average profit earned by selling the house after one year, the lengths of the sticks showing the amount of profit earned, while the tips are coloured by the estimated house price after 1 year.

### Key Insights
The visualisations showed the best boroughs to invest in property. Key insights were the following.
- Housing prices have generally been on the rise and so investing in property is profitable.  
- Based the return of investment City of London, Westminster and Greenwich are the most profitable.  
- Westminster also has the highest number of Airbnb listings and with high prices per listing most likely due to the borough's proximity to toutist attractions as can be seen from the geo-plot.  
- Islington and Hackney are not preferred for Airbnb rentals and the listings in these areas have low occupancy rates.  
- The boroughs to buy property for resale are Wandsworth and Westminster.
